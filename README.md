# Supervised Learning
## Overview
Following 5 learning algorithms are implemented: 
* Decision trees with pruning
* Neural networks
* Boosting
* Support Vector Machines
* k-nearest neighbors
Datasets were Adult and Wine data sets from UCI machine learning repository. 
## Steps to Run
1. Install following requirements:
numpy == 1.15.1
scipy == 1.1.0
scikit-learn == 0.20.0
pandas == 0.23.4
xlrd == 0.9.0
matplotlib == 2.2.3
seaborn == 0.9.0
scikit-optimize == 0.5.2
kneed == 0.1.0

2. Run following files with jython to create the data files
NN-Backprop.py
NN-GA.py
NN-RHC.py
NN-SA.py
continuoutpeaks.py
flipflop.py
tsp.py

3. Run plotting.py with python3 to generate charts
